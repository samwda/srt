## 🧩 Usage

To display the reading time anywhere in your post, simply add the following shortcode:

```

This will output something like:

> Reading Time: 4 minutes

## 🧠 How Reading Time Is Calculated

- The plugin counts all words in the current post or page content.
- Default reading speed is **200 words per minute**.
- The number of words is divided by 200, then rounded up to the nearest full minute.

For example:

- 765 words / 200 = 3.825
- Rounded = 4 minutes
